## 🔬 Physics

Given details about the **sound source** and the **receptor**, the software generates audio simulating sound emission while accounting for the distortion caused by the **Doppler Effect**.

---

## ➗ Advanced Calculus

The **sine wave** used in audio generation is calculated using the **Maclaurin series**, ensuring a mathematical approach to waveform synthesis.

---

## 💻 Object-Oriented Programming

The program is structured using the **Object-Oriented Programming** paradigm, promoting modularity, readability, and ease of modification.

---

## 🗄️ Database

By using **SQL**, the software allows users to **save** information about:

- The environment
- The audio source
- The experiment

This data can be **reused** in future studies or experiments.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Minimalist Design

The software features a **simple** and **user-friendly** interface for seamless interaction.

### 🎼 Tone Selection

When creating an audio source, users can select from a **variety of tones**, offering flexibility in simulating different sound scenarios.

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaway

This project integrates **physics simulation**, **mathematical modeling**, **programming paradigms**, and **data persistence** to create a comprehensive and educational audio simulator.
