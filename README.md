## Collaborators

[VÃ­tor Braghittoni](https://github.com/VBraghittoni), [Nicolas Birochi](https://github.com/nicholasbirochi), [Henrico Birochi](https://github.com/henricobirochi), and [Edgar Camacho](https://github.com/Edgarcsr) created this project.

## Physics
Given information about the sound source and the receptor, this software generates audio simulating sound emission, considering the distortion caused by the Doppler Effect.

## Advanced Calculus
The sine wave used for the audio generation is obtained using the Maclaurin series.

## Object-Oriented Programming
This program is organized using the Object-Oriented paradigm, making it easier to understand and modify.

## Database
Using SQL, it is possible to save information about the environment, audio source, and the experiment itself. This allows the information to be reused in future studies.

# Features

## Minimalist design
This software has a simple and easy-to-use interface.

## Tone
When creating an audio source in the system, the user can select from a variety of tones.
